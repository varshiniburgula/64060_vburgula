#various choices made in conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for 
#different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) used, the number of
#clusters formed, and so on.

#From the above graphs,we can say that there is a slight pattern in the clusters.
# he companies are evenly dispersed throughout AMEX, NASDAQ, and NYSE but the #cluster 1 has different Hold and Moderate Buy medians, differing counts from the US and Germany.
#Equal Hold and Moderate Buy medians are found in Cluster 2, which is solely listed #on the NYSE and is evenly split between the US and Canada.
#The Cluster 3 has equal Moderate Buy and Sell medians,different count from 
#countries France, Ireland and US and are listed in NYSE.
#The Cluster 4 has different Hold, Moderate buy, Moderate Sell and Strong buy 
#medians with the hold having the highest median. They're from countries US, UK 
#and Switzerland and they are listed in NYSE.
# The Cluster 5 has the same hold and mdoerate buy medians, is distributed in 
#countries UK and US and is also listed in NYSE.
